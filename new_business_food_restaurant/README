The document is designed to help understand the following aspects:
    How to open a project with data from different repositories
    What does each of the framework files mean
    How to start writing auto-tests

All information about framework and instruction how start to work you can find here:

""Description of files in framework"""

1. What is structure?
In our framework, we use Page Object pattern, which means all page elements and actions are stored separately from test
steps and a class is created for any page. Main folders you will have are:

 - Framework - common framework for all journeys. Ideally, there should be no changes (if you need anything in addition,
please contact n.pleshkun or d.ananyev and we will solve this out)
 - browser - BrowserFactory class returns a browser based on configurations in config.py. Browser class provides actions
 like closing, quitting, navigating between pages. Those browsers are initialized in conftest.py file (stored in tests
 folder for each journey)
 - configuration - folder with basic configurations (you can just copy it into your journey configurations)
 - constants - folder with global constants like browser names, file extensions etc
 - elements - folder with all elements like Buttons, labels etc. It contains BaseElement class in base subfolder, from
which all elements are inherited.
 - forms - a folder with base form (form is a group of elements which is used in several places in the app). So whenever
 you'd like to create a form inherit it from BaseForm
 - pages - a folder with base page, from which all pages in your journey should inherit. It has some basic methods
inside like waiting for page to load, refreshing etc
 - scripts - a folder with some basic js scripts for actions like scrolling, which cannot be performed using selenium.
 - utils - a folder with classes-helpers. Any common actions like reading filed, taking screenshots, working with
database should be stored there
 - waits - classes-helpers which provide common functionality of waiting for conditions (ready state complete, condition
is true)

2. Folder with journey contains the following:
 - configuration - contains browser, environment, locale etc
 - pages - all pages related to your tests. 1 file - 1 class, each class describes 1 page (contains page elements and
actions to perform)
 - tests - a folder with tests, contains subfolders for different features (e.g. Search for Home, apply for Loan etc)

 VERY IMPORTANT:
 For running autotests from different journeys (or only your journey) in the project - need write correct name of
 journey (the main folder with your tests) in init_.py file according instruction here:

3. Via this framework you can run tests via desktop browsers and mobile devices.
